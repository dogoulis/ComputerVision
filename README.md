# ComputerVision
A university project for computer vision. This code implements a from scratch 3d convolution and applies this in a video (while turning into grayscale).


myConv3d:
This function implements a 3d convolution. It can be used for videos (NOT a frame per frame convolution!! -- this is a 2d convolution).


create_smooth_kernel:
creates a kernel matrix of a given size.


pad_image:
pads a given image with a given stride for convolution.
